# GainsKeeper :muscle: :clipboard:

This project is a simple system you can use to track your latest workouts, so you always know exactly to do for your next workout.
You can select the different exercises you want to do, and then add sets, reps and preferred weight. You can then update the data as you progress.

## Tech stack :computer:
The project is built purely with Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. There is no backend, so localStorage is being used for storing data.

The external data in the project is fetched from Zyla's Exercise Database API:

***April 18 2023: The functional part of the project is complete, although you might encounter a few little bugs that need to be taken care of. The UI design and responsiveness are still a work in progress.***
